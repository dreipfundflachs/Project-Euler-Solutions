# Solutions to the first 100 Project Euler problems

## Features

This repository contains solutions to each of the first 100 problems on [Project
Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net), written in Python 3. It also includes:

* All _auxiliary files_ provided in the problem statements (among the first
  100); these are named 'p0\d\d_\*.txt'
* A _module_ PE_UTILITIES.py compiling the most useful functions that I had
  to write to solve these problems. It is however not necessary to import this
  module for any of the scripts to work.
* A _template_ PROBLEM_TEMPLATE.py for the solution scripts.


## Benchmarks

All of these solutions are original (in the sense of not having been taken from
someone else). The following among them take more than 1 second to execute (on
my computer):
